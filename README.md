## Sentiment Analysis
Approximately 1,000 Enron emails were manually annotated with the document sentiment and then used to fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model for sentiment classification. These annotated emails were then passed through a Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer and used to train a Naive Bayes classifier to establish a baseline for performance. This classifier achieved a micro-average ROC-AUC of 0.75 and an accuracy of 57.26%.

The training documents were then tokenized using the appropriate BERT tokenizer and converted to PyTorch tensors of token ids and attention masks for input into the pre-trained BERT model. To boost the training speed and save memory, the PyTorch DataLoader class was utilized to create an iterator for the dataset. 

A custom BERT Classifier class and training loop was constructed around the bert-base-uncased pre-trained model. 5 training epochs were run with accuracy trailing off after the 5th epoch. The BERT Classifier achieved a micro-average ROC-AUC of 0.86 and an accuracy of 69.23%, representing a nearly 12% increase in accuracy over the Naive Bayes Classifier.

This model was then used to predict the sentiment for an additional 144,000 Enron e-mails. The predicted email sentiment was then aggregated by day using the sum of positive e-mails (value of +1) and negative emails (value of -1) to analyze the broad changes in the sentiment of emails sent and received by Enron employees over time. As seen in the chart to the right in a 14-day Moving Average of the email sentiment, the emails got progressively more negative in aggregate as the Enron scandal unfolded and the companyâ€™s stock price collapsed. October and November of 2001 were the height of the scandal, and that is clearly reflected in employee email sentiment.
