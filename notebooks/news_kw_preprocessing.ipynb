      "Analyzing Enron can be deeply frustrating. “It’s very difficult for us on Wall Street with as little information as we have,” says Fleischer, who is a big bull. (The same is true for Enron’s competitors, but “wholesale operations” are usually a smaller part of their business, and they trade at far lower multiples.) “Enron is a big black box,” gripes another analyst. Without having access to each and every one of Enron’s contracts and its minute-by-minute activities, there isn’t any way to independently answer critical questions about the company. For instance, many Wall Streeters believe that the current volatility in gas and power markets is boosting Enron’s profits, but there is no way to know for sure. “The ability to develop a somewhat predictable model of this business for the future is mostly an exercise in futility,” wrote Bear Stearns analyst Robert Winters in a recent report.\n",

      "Actually, analysts don’t seem to have a clue what’s in Assets and Investments or, more to the point, what sort of earnings it will generate. Enron’s results from that part of its business tend to be quite volatile—profits fell from $325 million in the second quarter of 1999 to $55 million in the second quarter of 2000. In written reports, Morgan Stanley chalked up the decline to the poor performance of Enron’s “significant number of investments” in telecom stocks; Dain Rauscher Wessels blamed it on a lack of asset sales.\n",

      "There are other concerns: Despite the fact that Enron has been talking about reducing its debt, in the first nine months of 2000 its debt went up substantially. During this period, Enron issued a net $3.9 billion in debt, bringing its total debt up to a net $13 billion at the end of September and its debt-to-capital ratio up to 50%, vs. 39% at the end of 1999. Nor does Enron make life easy for those who measure the health of a business by its cash flow from operations. In 1999 its cash flow from operations fell from $1.6 billion the previous year to $1.2 billion. In the first nine months of 2000, the company generated just $100 million in cash. (In fact, cash flow would have been negative if not for the $410 million in tax breaks it received from employees’ exercising their options.)\n",

      "That’s good, because Enron will need plenty of cash to fund its new, high-cost initiatives: namely, the high-cost buildout of its broadband operations. In order to facilitate its plan to trade excess bandwidth capacity, Enron is constructing its own network. This requires big capital expenditures. So broadband had better be a good business. Both Enron and some of the analysts who cover it think it already is. Included in the $126 a share that Enron says it’s worth is $40 a share—or $35 billion—for broadband. Several of Enron’s analysts value broadband at $25 a share, or roughly $22 billion (and congratulate themselves for being conservative). But $22 billion seems like a high valuation for a business that reported $408 million of revenues and $60 million of losses in 2000. Not all analysts are so aggressive. “Valuing the broadband business is an “extremely difficult, uncertain exercise at this point in time,” notes Bear Stearns’ Winters, who thinks that broadband, while promising, is worth some $5 a share today.\n",

      "\"Bizarre\" is how everyone describes it. On Aug. 14, Enron CEO Jeff Skilling--a self-described \"brilliant\" 47-year-old who says he's never suffered any kind of failure--announced he was relinquishing his title and leaving the company after a mere six months in the top job. Skilling insisted that the parting was voluntary, laying the blame on unspecified personal, non-health-related reasons. But by leaving when and how he did, Skilling forfeited a roughly $20 million severance package and gained the responsibility of repaying a $2 million loan that Enron would have forgiven had he stuck around until the end of the year.\n",

      "And well they did. For if gas has been good to Enron, electric power has been great. Because Enron was already the biggest trader in gas, and because roughly a third of all natural gas is used to fire the boilers in electric power plants, the company found it could strike more complex and daring deals for electricity than the average power generator could. Maybe Enron agrees to sell a zillion watts of power to Kokomo Electric this summer, confident it has all its sources of supply lined up. But come July it discovers it could sell that power at a higher price to Tuscaloosa Incandescent. Perhaps Enron can persuade Kokomo to take a zillion units of bargain-priced natural gas instead and make its own power. If Kokomo balks, Enron might ask a power plant near Kokomo to take the gas, make electricity, and ship it at a profit to Kokomo.\n",

      "The company also found that plunging quickly and aggressively into new markets gave it a good shot at outmaneuvering competitors that entered later. The more customers and more suppliers Enron (or any trading company) has, the more options it has in cobbling together a deal. When Enron agrees to provide electric power to a big utility, it may be repackaging power it bought from ten different suppliers under ten different conditions. The more suppliers it has, the more artfully it can pick out a kilowatt here and another one there before putting them on a plate for the customer. Enron traders compare dealmaking to solving jigsaw puzzles--plucking out the kilowatts from its inventory that are configured in ways that fit the customer's needs. The same advantage derives from having more customers than the competition; it means Enron has more places to unload those kilowatts at good prices. Borrowing the language of the Internet (never a bad tongue to speak when Wall Street is listening), Enron claims that being firstest with the mostest gives it the impregnable \"first-mover advantage\" of an eBay or a Yahoo. That may be a bit grandiose: Enron's U.S. trading volumes are only about 25% ahead of its next competitors'--although, to be fair, Enron has held the lead consistently for years.\n",

      "Enron's stock began its plunge in mid-October after the company announced its third-quarter results. As always, Enron made its earnings number--that is, before a gigantic, $1.01 billion charge due to a slew of investments gone sour. Worse, Enron was less than up-front about an additional $1.2 billion reduction in shareholders' equity, caused by the early termination of controversial outside investment partnerships run by former Enron CFO Andy Fastow. Lay reassured investors that Enron's credit rating was intact but made no mention of Moody's, which after the call put Enron's debt on review for a possible downgrade. As Enron acknowledges, it is critical that the company's debt be rated investment-grade, given the requirements of its huge trading operations. Enron's debt is currently rated several notches above investment-grade, and at the end of the second quarter the company had $12 billion in debt, or a not unhealthy debt-to-capitalization ratio of 46%.

Of course, now that it's clear that those earnings weren't what they appeared, the new cliche is that Enron's business was incredibly complicated--perhaps even too complicated for founder Ken Lay to understand (something Lay has implied since retaking the CEO title from Skilling last summer).
